# Depression Detection using Machine Learning

This project builds a **machine learning model** to detect depressive tendencies from social media text using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

## 🧠 Overview
- Preprocessed tweets by cleaning, removing slang, and tokenization, etc. reference - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/python-efficient-text-data-cleaning/
- Extracted features using character n-gram TF-IDF.
- Trained and evaluated multiple models (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.), finaaly landing on linear SVC.
- Achieved **88.9% accuracy** on test data.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib
